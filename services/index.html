                <p>It can be difficult to know what neuropsychology support you need. To help, Neuropsychological Health provides a consultation model, whereby you can avail of a 1 to 1.5-hour online consultation. After the consultation, a summary letter will be provided to you.</p>

                <div class="right">
                    <p>A neuropsychological assessment is a detailed evaluation of your memory, concentration, language, and other cognitive skills. These assessments are helpful if you have concerns about your thinking and cognitive abilities, providing detailed information about cognitive strengths and difficulties.</p>
                    <p>Neuropsychological assessments typically start with an online consultation if this is feasible for you. Neuropsychology Health offers two types of assessment: a screening assessment and a comprehensive assessment. It is most helpful if these assessments are completed based on referral from a GP, neurologist or other relevant professional. Support recommendations, which are tailored to the focus of the assessment and your goals, will be provided in the report sent to you after the assessment.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes, it is not appropriate to administer formal neuropsychological tests for various reasons such as the time since the brain injury. In these instances, an assessment may still be completed but will include a clinical interview with you and possibly the administration of some questionnaires.</p>
                    <p>Neuropsychology Health can provide neuropsychological assessments and tailored reports for a wide range of referral reasons including mild traumatic brain injury as well as moderate and severe brain injury. We can also provide assessments to aid in understanding cognitive versus psychological factors that might be impacting on everyday life or to support a return to work after brain injury or neurological illness.</p>

                <div class="right">
                    <p>Neuropsychological assessments to aid in the diagnosis of dementia are provided by Neuropsychology Health. We can also assess your cognitive functioning after receiving a diagnosis, should you wish to understand more about your cognitive abilities and how to manage any changes you have noticed. Please note that a diagnosis of dementia must be made by a suitably qualified medical professional such as a neurologist, medicine of the elderly consultant, or a GP. They may request a neuropsychological assessment to assist in making a diagnosis. To ensure the assessment is as helpful as possible, a short referral letter from your neurologist, consultant, or GP is required. If a diagnosis has been made, you can self-refer for a neuropsychological assessment. These assessments will also start with an online consultation unless this is not suitable for you.</p>

                    <p>Neuropsychology Health offers psychological therapy and neuropsychological rehabilitation sessions for adults adjusting to brain injury and neurological illness. It can be very difficult to come to terms with and adapt to the changes involved in living with a neurological condition. You may experience several losses (e.g., loss of independence, loss of physical abilities), which can affect your confidence in coping with everyday life. Commonly reported emotional and behavioral difficulties can include feelings of low mood or depression, anxiety, worry, frustration, or anger.</p>
                    <p>Neuropsychological rehabilitation aims to help individuals manage and come to terms with changes following a brain injury or neurological condition. Neuropsychology Health provides specialist cognitive rehabilitation with a therapeutic focus, integrating psychological support. You will receive psychological support while developing new skills to manage cognitive challenges. We also provide specialist psychological support for adults experiencing trauma related to brain injury or neurological illness.</p>
